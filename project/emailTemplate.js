Dear ${hrName},

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my keen interest in job opportunities at ${companyName}.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been actively building projects that demonstrate my practical skills in modern web development technologies.

I am particularly drawn to ${companyName}'s innovative work in web technologies and believe my enthusiasm for full-stack development, combined with my technical foundation in the MERN stack, would make me a valuable addition to your team. I am eager to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting while learning from your experienced developers.

I have attached my resume which details my academic projects and technical skills. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to ${companyName}'s development.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team.
